# String Spacing Rule
*String Spacing Rule for stringed instrument nuts*

It is a software version of the string spacing rule like the ones sold from a bunch of luthier supply companies. It uses as inputs the overall width of the nut,the inwards clearance of the two outer strings, the total number of strings in the instrument as well as the proportion ratio between strings. The end result shows the center to center distance between the strings from treble to bass, just like the real hardware version.

If you want to read more about the tool, you can read the excellent explanation in [Frets](http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Luthier/Tools/NutRule/nutrule.html) and in [StewMac](https://www.stewmac.com/video-and-ideas/online-resources/learn-about-guitar-nut-and-saddle-setup-and-repair/string-spacing-rule-instructions/)
