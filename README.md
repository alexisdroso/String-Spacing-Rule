# String-Spacing-Rule
String Spacing Rule for stringed instrument nuts

It is a software version of the string spacing rule like the ones sold from a bunch of luthier supply companies. It uses as inputs the width of the nut,the spacing of the two outer strings, the number of strings in the instrument as well as the proportion ratio between strings. The results are in metric, but can be easily converted in inches. The end result shows the center to center distance between the strings from treble to bass, just like the hardware version of the string spacing rule.

If you want to read further about the thinking behind such a tool, you can read the excellent explanation in http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Luthier/Tools/NutRule/nutrule.html. 

The code is written in python, but there are plans to make a web version too, some time in the future.
